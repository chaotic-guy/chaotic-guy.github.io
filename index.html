      <h2 class="section-title">What is Chaos Theory?</h2>
      <p>
        At first glance, the world can seem chaotic—storms arise, traffic jams appear, opportunities come and go, and life unfolds unpredictably. 
        But beneath this apparent randomness lies a profound truth: systems that seem disorderly often follow hidden patterns and simple rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chaos theory isn’t about disarray or confusion—it’s about understanding the surprising order within the unpredictable. 
        Even the most complex systems, from weather patterns to human decisions, have an underlying logic. To see it, we must start with the smallest pieces.
      </p>

    <section id="butterfly-effect">
      <h2 class="section-title">How Chaos Theory Was Discovered: The Butterfly Effect</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1960s, Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist, was studying how to predict the weather using one of the earliest computers. 
        His program used equations to simulate atmospheric conditions—temperature, pressure, wind speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, Lorenz rounded one variable in his simulation, changing 0.506127 to 0.506. It seemed trivial, but the outcome was entirely different. 
        This small change caused wildly different weather patterns, demonstrating the profound sensitivity of chaotic systems to initial conditions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This became known as the butterfly effect—a poetic metaphor for how small actions can amplify into massive consequences over time.

    <section id="chaos-vs-randomness">
      <h2 class="section-title">What Makes Chaos Different From Randomness?</h2>
      <p>
        At first, chaos might feel like randomness—but they’re profoundly different. Randomness is pure noise, like the roll of dice or static on a television screen. 
        It has no structure, no hidden logic. Chaos, however, has boundaries. It is governed by rules that create patterns—unpredictable, yes, but not lawless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of cream swirling in coffee. The patterns are intricate, almost hypnotic, yet they follow the physics of fluid dynamics. 
        Chaos is this kind of structured unpredictability. A famous example is the Lorenz attractor, a visualization of a chaotic system that loops infinitely but never repeats.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Chaos Mascot: Taz</h2>
      <p>
        Chaos is not mere disorder; it is energy, motion, and the delicate dance between creation and destruction. It exists where the predictable dissolves and possibility emerges, untamed and alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taz—the irrepressible Tasmanian Devil—is chaos made flesh. He spins, growls, and tears through landscapes, leaving everything fundamentally altered. Yet his destruction is never without purpose. Taz clears, creates, and transforms. 
        Like chaos itself, his whirlwind represents transformation and the potential for reinvention.

    <section id="chaos-ai">
      <h2 class="section-title">Chaos and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Chaos theory teaches us that even the smallest shifts can ripple into monumental change. Artificial intelligence thrives on this principle, amplifying minor changes into creative breakthroughs or incomprehensible anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI operates on the edge of chaos and order, where adaptability and unpredictability generate innovation. Much like the butterfly effect, small tweaks in AI systems can cascade into profound outcomes. Chaos is not a flaw—it is the spark of creativity.
