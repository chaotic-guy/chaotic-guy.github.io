      <h2>What is Chaos Theory?</h2>
      <p>
        At first glance, the world can seem chaotic—storms arise, traffic jams appear, opportunities come and go, and life unfolds unpredictably.
        But beneath this apparent randomness lies a profound truth: systems that seem disorderly often follow hidden patterns and simple rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chaos theory isn’t about disarray or confusion—it’s about understanding the surprising order within the unpredictable.
        Even the most complex systems, from weather patterns to human decisions, have an underlying logic.
      </p>

    <section id="butterfly-effect" class="tab-content">
      <h2>How Chaos Theory Was Discovered: The Butterfly Effect</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This poetic metaphor from Edward Lorenz illustrates the butterfly effect—a small action that can ripple into massive consequences.
        Lorenz’s weather simulations demonstrated how small changes in initial conditions could lead to entirely different outcomes.

    <section id="chaos-vs-randomness" class="tab-content">
      <h2>What Makes Chaos Different From Randomness?</h2>
      <p>
        Randomness is pure noise, like static on a television. Chaos, however, has boundaries and underlying patterns.
        Think of cream swirling in coffee—the patterns may seem wild, but they follow the physics of fluid dynamics.

    <section id="chaos-mascot" class="tab-content">
      <h2>The Chaos Mascot: Taz</h2>
      <p>
        Taz—the irrepressible Tasmanian Devil—represents chaos incarnate. His whirlwind isn’t just destruction; it clears space for reinvention.
        Like chaos itself, Taz embodies the delicate dance between creation and destruction.

    <section id="chaos-ai" class="tab-content">
      <h2>Chaos and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence thrives on chaos, amplifying minor changes into creative breakthroughs or unexpected anomalies.
        Like the butterfly effect, small tweaks in AI systems can ripple into monumental outcomes. Chaos isn’t a flaw—it’s a feature of innovation.
