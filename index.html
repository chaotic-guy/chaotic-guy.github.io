      <h2>About Just a Chaotic Guy</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the realm of chaos-driven creativity. "Just a Chaotic Guy" celebrates unpredictability, inspiring innovation 
        in crypto, art, and beyond. Through our journey, we aim to transform chaos into meaningful change.

    <!-- Chaos Theory Section -->
    <section id="chaos-theory" class="tab-content">
      <h2>What is Chaos Theory?</h2>
      <p>
        At first glance, the world can seem chaotic—storms arise, traffic jams appear, opportunities come and go, and life unfolds unpredictably.
        But beneath this apparent randomness lies a profound truth: systems that seem disorderly often follow hidden patterns and simple rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chaos theory isn’t about disarray or confusion—it’s about understanding the surprising order within the unpredictable.
        It shows us that even the most complex systems, from weather patterns to human decisions, have an underlying logic.
        To see it, we must start with the smallest pieces.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Butterfly Effect Section -->
    <section id="butterfly-effect" class="tab-content">
      <h2>How Chaos Theory Was Discovered: The Butterfly Effect</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This poetic metaphor from Edward Lorenz illustrates the butterfly effect—a small action that can ripple into massive consequences.
        Lorenz’s weather simulations demonstrated how small changes in initial conditions could lead to entirely different outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This phenomenon shows us how small choices and shifts can amplify into life-changing outcomes.

    <!-- Chaos vs Randomness Section -->
    <section id="chaos-vs-randomness" class="tab-content">
      <h2>What Makes Chaos Different From Randomness?</h2>
      <p>
        Randomness is pure noise, like the roll of dice or static on a television screen. It has no structure, no hidden logic. Chaos, however, has boundaries. It is governed by rules that create patterns—unpredictable, yes, but not lawless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of cream swirling in coffee. The patterns are intricate, almost hypnotic, yet they follow the physics of fluid dynamics. Chaos is this kind of structured unpredictability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A famous example of chaos’s structure is the Lorenz attractor, a mathematical visualization of how a system behaves over time.
      </p>

    <!-- Chaos Mascot Section -->
    <section id="chaos-mascot" class="tab-content">
      <h2>The Chaos Mascot: Taz</h2>
      <p>
        Chaos is not mere disorder; it is energy, motion, and the delicate dance between creation and destruction. It exists where the predictable dissolves and possibility emerges, untamed and alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taz, the irrepressible Tasmanian Devil, represents chaos incarnate. His whirlwind isn’t just destruction; it clears space for reinvention. Like chaos itself, Taz embodies the delicate dance between creation and destruction.
      </p>

    <!-- Chaos and AI Section -->
    <section id="chaos-ai" class="tab-content">
      <h2>Chaos and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Chaos is the driving force of AI’s creativity. Small changes in data, models, or algorithms can ripple into brilliant solutions 
        or unexpected anomalies. This unpredictability mirrors life itself—messy yet innovative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like chaos, AI thrives on the edge of order, where imagination sparks transformation.

    <!-- Chaos in Everyday Life Section -->
    <section id="chaos-everyday" class="tab-content">
      <h2>How Chaos Shapes Everyday Life</h2>
      <p>
        Chaos isn’t just a scientific concept—it’s woven into the fabric of your life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic Jams:</strong> A single car braking slightly can create a wave of slowing vehicles, eventually causing a jam.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> A chance meeting can spark conversations, ideas, and a completely new chapter in life.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media Virality:</strong> One post, shared at the right time, can spiral into millions of views.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Roadmap Section -->
    <section id="roadmap" class="tab-content">
